Besides the parallel program of Hadoop-EDF and sequential program, I also did one more experiment for The related works by Jayapandian et al. have used the MapReduce framework 
to process electrophysiological signals in parallel for epilepsy research. However, they didnâ€™t split an EDF file to chunk. They defined one map task to process an entire EDF file
which is a key factor slowing down the performance.
